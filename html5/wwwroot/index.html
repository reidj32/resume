                                            <li>As part of Guaranty Bank's purchase by
                                                First Citizens bank, all customer
                                                data needed to be exported from our
                                                systems into those used by First
                                                Citizens bank.</li>
                                            <li>After asking our core provider for an
                                                estimate to have the export done,
                                                we decided to build a tool to handle
                                                the export process. This tool extracted
                                                and converted terabytes of customer
                                                data from our systems, and prepared
                                                it for importing into the target
                                                systems at First Citizens bank. This
                                                project saved the bank over $250,000
                                                in a single year.</li>

                                            <li>Designed as a website for branch users,
                                                this application was created to help
                                                customers increase their credit scores.
                                                The website was built using ASP.NET
                                                MVC 5 (Razor syntax), Javascript
                                                (with jQuery), and Bootstrap 3. Data
                                                persistence was achieved with Entity
                                                Framework 6 and SQL Server.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>The process was very simple, a customer
                                                would come into the branch and work
                                                with a teller through a wizard in
                                                the web site. At the end of the wizard
                                                they would immediately find out if
                                                they were approved to receive the
                                                product.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>During the wizard, the application would
                                                access our internal TransUnion integration
                                                (Web API 2) for the customer to see
                                                his/her current credit score.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>As the customer would repay the loan
                                                effectively taken out, their scores
                                                would change as we reported successful

                                                The website was built using ASP.NET
                                                Web API and ASP.NET MVC. Once the

                                            <li>Originally, the team built all software
                                                our their local machines and manually
                                                published these package to development
                                                servers. This practice proved to
                                                be cumbersome and error prone. To
                                                resolve those issues, we experimented
                                                with the build tools provided by
                                                Team Foundation Server (TFS).</li>
                                            <li>Once properly configured, we were able
                                                to utilize features such as continuous
                                                integration (CI), gated check-ins,
                                                and environment based deployments.
                                                CI increased the team's code quality
                                                and reduced the bugs we introduced
                                                to test and production environments.
                                                Gated check-ins allowed the team
                                                to be more aware of what changes
                                                were being made to different applications
                                                if several developers were working
                                                on the same project at once.</li>
                                            <li>Environment based deployments benefited
                                                the system administrators as well.
                                                Because the build server handled
                                                all the configuration for a specific
                                                environment, they were able to spend
                                                time on other tasks instead of constantly
                                                working with the development team
                                                to get a build properly configured
                                                each time a new deployment was needed.
                                                By removing the need to have a system
                                                administrator manual edit configuration
                                                file, errors were greatly reduced,
                                                and productivity was increased.</li>

                                                Our core provider offered tools to
                                                achieve the desired result, but they
                                                were deemed far too expensive. The
                                                least expensive option was to received
                                                all data in a batch format each day.
                                                Because the batched data wasn't usable
                                                in its delivered format, it had to

                                                and work with the developer to ensure
                                                the best deployments possible.

                                            <li>Due to the size of the database, performance
                                                was a concern. Regular testing was
                                                done to ensure table performance
                                                was fast enough to meet daily scheduling
                                                deadlines during imports, and for
                                                reporting. If needed, indexes would
                                                be tested and added to maintain the
                                                required performance constraints.

                                            <li>When the bank accrued a high number of
                                                delinquent accounts, they would be
                                                sold to a debt collector as a means
                                                for the bank to recoup some lost
                                                revenue.

                                            <li>To complete the sale of accounts, they
                                                first had to be processed by our
                                                core provider to ready them. The
                                                process involved created a fixed
                                                width file containing the relevant
                                                fields needed to adjust the accounts.
                                                To create this file, a console application
                                                utilizing command line switches was
                                                built by the development team. Because
                                                different fields were added or removed
                                                from the fixed width output file,
                                                the Managed Extensibility Framework

                                                flexibility in which fields were
                                                injected into the output file with

                                                for the sale, an export of all required
                                                account documents was needed. Because
                                                no export tool was provided to aggregate
                                                these documents, we created a tool
                                                to handle the task using the existing
                                                API provided by our imaging and reporting

                                                a calculator, the prospect may engage
                                                with the bank, and the bank would
                                                then require a larger product offering
                                                from Advicent.</li>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Over time, we learned that more data
                                                was needed to accurately predict
                                                a person's true monetary needs over
                                                time. To do this, we start a project
                                                to store such data in a warehouse.</li>
                                            <li>MongoDB was selected as the primary data
                                                store for the customer data as it
                                                served our needs the best. Customer
                                                data could already be represented
                                                in XML format, so transforming it
                                                to JSON (the primary storage media
                                                for MongoDB), was very easy.

                                            <li>Some primary examples of tools built
                                                were Quality Assurance (QA) automation
                                                tools, and customer branding.</li>
                                            <li>The QA tools were created to help the
                                                team deploy new application builds
                                                to different environments quickly.
                                                This allowed the team to test different
                                                builds of a product much more quickly
                                                without the need to get the development

                                                team involved.</li>
                                            <li>The customer branding tool was designed
                                                for the sales team to customize the
                                                interface of the application quickly
                                                with a few simple clicks through
                                                a XAML based Windows desktop application.
                                                The tool allowed for custom application
                                                coloring, custom fonts, and company
                                                images to be applied to the primary
                                                product. After all choices were made
                                                by the user, a definition file was
                                                exported to the primary product and
                                                assigned to the customer who designed
                                                the branding changes. This product
                                                saved the development and sales team
                                                a great deal of time since there
                                                was no longer a need to work back
                                                and forth with a customer on the
                                                outside making little changes when
                                                they didn't like how the final product
                                                appeared.

                                                and understanding now the product
                                                functioned represented a small portion
                                                of these calls. If the product support
                                                team was unable to describe a piece
                                                of functionality to the customer's
                                                liking, a member of the development
                                                would work with a business analyst
                                                to ensure the customer received an
                                                acceptable answer.</li>
                                            <li>Bug reports were among the most common
                                                issues reported. Bugs would first
                                                have to be reproduced, and then assessed.
                                                If the bug was a small edge case
                                                and a workaround was present, it
                                                could be deferred to a later product
                                                update. However, if a bug caused
                                                incorrect calculations in the primary
                                                financial product, a hotfix would
                                                be implemented quickly and communicated
                                                to the customer.</li>

                                    <li>Worked directly with business analysts and product
                                        managers to help define the product road-map,
                                        and the features that were most desired by
                                        customers.

                                                helped the development team understand
                                                the product we were building. This
                                                lead to us making better decisions
                                                about how a feature or bug should
                                                be implemented/resolved.</li>

                                                By providing details to the help documentation and

                                                entry point for new team members
                                                to learn about the product we built.</li>

                                    <li>Participated in code reviews with peers prior
                                        to the check-in of any source code changes.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>These reviews were intended as a means
                                                to ensure high quality code.</li>
                                            <li>A major benefit of doing the reviews
                                                with other teams members was the
                                                exposure given to the team as a whole.
                                                If more team members were exposed
                                                to the changes being made, it would
                                                aid in the learning of the application,
                                                and speed up future development since
                                                those people exposed already knew
                                                why certain changes were made.</li>
                                            <li>By having multiple developers review
                                                changes, the product was less likely
                                                to suffer from conflicting changes
                                                since others were aware of what changes
                                                were happening to the entire code
                                                base. The communication enabled by
                                                this practice helped to prevent breaking
                                                changes in future projects.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Trained new developers an quality assurance analysts
                                        as the joined our team.

                                            <li>
                                                By onboarding new team members quickly, and in a shared capacity, the development
                                                team was able to work much more efficiently.
                                                We were also given the opportunity
                                                to get to know new team members right

                                                early on.

                                                being taught during the semester.</li>

                                                responsibility of the lab assistant
                                                to aid the student in finishing their
                                                work on time.</li>

                                                with the course work, the lab assistant

                                                to ensure the student would successfully
                                                complete the course material.</li>
