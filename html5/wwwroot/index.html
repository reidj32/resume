                                                    <li>Over time, we learned that more

                                                        we start a project to store
                                                        such data in a warehouse.</li>

                                                        the best. Customer data could
                                                        already be represented in
                                                        XML format, so transforming
                                                        it to JSON (the primary storage
                                                        media for MongoDB), was very
                                                        easy.

                                            <li>Team sizes typically consisted of 3-4
                                                developers (including the lead),
                                                1 quality assurance analyst, 1 business
                                                analyst, and 1 project manager. This
                                                small team worked together with other
                                                teams of similar sizing to complete
                                                major application milestones over
                                                several months, or even years.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Built and maintained
                                        <i>in-house</i> software to be used as tools
                                        for departments needing them.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Some primary examples of tools built
                                                were Quality Assurance (QA) automation
                                                tools, and customer branding.</li>
                                            <li>The QA tools were created to help the
                                                team deploy new application builds
                                                to different environments quickly.
                                                This allowed the team to test different
                                                builds of a product much more quickly
                                                without the need to get the development
                                                team, or the system administrator
                                                team involved.</li>
                                            <li>The customer branding tool was designed
                                                for the sales team to customize the
                                                interface of the application quickly
                                                with a few simple clicks through
                                                a XAML based Windows desktop application.
                                                The tool allowed for custom application
                                                coloring, custom fonts, and company
                                                images to be applied to the primary
                                                product. After all choices were made
                                                by the user, a definition file was
                                                exported to the primary product and
                                                assigned to the customer who designed
                                                the branding changes. This product
                                                saved the development and sales team
                                                a great deal of time since there
                                                was no longer a need to work back
                                                and forth with a customer on the
                                                outside making little changes when
                                                they didn't like how the final product
                                                appeared.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                                        Handled escalated issues from customers on an as needed basis. If the product support
                                        team was unable to resolve a customer issue,
                                        it would be sent to development and taken
                                        from a queue for support.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Issues regarding application support
                                                and understanding now the product
                                                functioned represented a small portion
                                                of these calls. If the product support
                                                team was unable to describe a piece
                                                of functionality to the customer's
                                                liking, a member of the development
                                                would work with a business analyst
                                                to ensure the customer received an
                                                acceptable answer.</li>
                                            <li>Bug reports were among the most common
                                                issues reported. Bugs would first
                                                have to be reproduced, and then assessed.
                                                If the bug was a small edge case
                                                and a workaround was present, it
                                                could be deferred to a later product
                                                update. However, if a bug caused
                                                incorrect calculations in the primary
                                                financial product, a hotfix would
                                                be implemented quickly and communicated
                                                to the customer.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Worked directly with business analysts and product
                                        managers to help define the product road-map,
                                        and the features that were most desired by
                                        customers.

                                            <li>Working closely with business analysts
                                                helped the development team understand
                                                the product we were building. This
                                                lead to us making better decisions
                                                about how a feature or bug should
                                                be implemented/resolved.</li>

                                        Contributed to the documentation of the products we sold.

                                            <li>
                                                By providing details to the help documentation and
                                                <em>How-Tos</em>, we created an easier

                                            <li>This documentation also served as an
                                                entry point for new team members
                                                to learn about the product we built.</li>

                                    </li>
                                    <li>Participated in code reviews with peers prior
                                        to the check-in of any source code changes.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>These reviews were intended as a means
                                                to ensure high quality code.</li>
                                            <li>A major benefit of doing the reviews
                                                with other teams members was the
                                                exposure given to the team as a whole.
                                                If more team members were exposed
                                                to the changes being made, it would
                                                aid in the learning of the application,
                                                and speed up future development since
                                                those people exposed already knew
                                                why certain changes were made.</li>
                                            <li>By having multiple developers review
                                                changes, the product was less likely
                                                to suffer from conflicting changes
                                                since others were aware of what changes
                                                were happening to the entire code
                                                base. The communication enabled by
                                                this practice helped to prevent breaking
                                                changes in future projects.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                                By onboarding new team members quickly, and in a shared capacity, the development
                                                team was able to work much more efficiently.
                                                We were also given the opportunity
                                                to get to know new team members right
                                                away and establish good communication
                                                early on.

                                                the course curriculum, providing
                                                a better experience for the students
                                                in the classroom.</li>
                                            <li>As a member of the class, students felt
                                                more comfortable working directly
                                                with the PAL when seeking out help
                                                for an assignment or lab work.</li>

                                    <li>Office hours were held by the PAL to provide
                                        students with an opportunity to receive help
                                        on their assignments and lab work.

                                            <li>If an exam was approaching, this was
                                                an opportunity for the students to
                                                ensure they were ready by working
                                                with the PAL to review any material
                                                that may show up on the exam.</li>
                                            <li>Because the PAL was a member of the class,
                                                he/she may not know all the details
                                                of the exam ahead of time. This meant
                                                the review sessions with students
                                                also taught good study habits since
                                                the PAL helped students prepare for
                                                the unknown the same way he/she would
                                                have.

                                            <li>Aside from helping students with their
                                                code, the PAL would also assist in
                                                the learning of the Integrated Development

                                                this was Visual Studio. For Java
